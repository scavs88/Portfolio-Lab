        <p>
            Well, I don't really do any blogging.  I think the point of this part isn't so much to focus on the blogging that I don't do but to see if I am about to set up the body of a paragraph on a page.  
            Hopefully I am right, because if my grade is based on how much blogging I do and, therefore; have material to talk about, I'm screwed.

        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently going through the daytime c# full stack boot camp at Grand Circus.  I plan on learning python directly after finishing boot camp.

        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Plymouth Michigan, which is a suburb of Detroit.  It was your typical white picket fence yuppy suburban town.  It is home to the largest high school system in Michigan PCEP, which consisted of 3 full sized high schools on one campus.  As as student I would have classes at all 3, it was set up very much like a college campus.
